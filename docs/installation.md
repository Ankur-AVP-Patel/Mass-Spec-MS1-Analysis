# Installing PGFinder

Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (it also works with
[anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), but we do not need the extra packages). With Conda installed,
run the following commands to create the virtual environment and activate it:


```bash
conda create --force -n pgfinder python=3.7
conda activate pgfinder
```

You're fine to use a different virtual environment, if you want!

## SQLite3

`PGFinder` uses [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html) in the background and you need this installed on your
system. Unfortunately `PGFinder` can not install this for you. Please install the latest version from
[here](https://sqlite.org/download.html) or use your Operating Systems package manager to install.

## Normal Use

### PyPi

`PGFinder` is available via the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/) and the latest release can be installed
under your virtual environment with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

``` bash
pip install pgfinder
```

### GitHub

If you do not intend to undertake any development on PGFinder and just wish to use it then you can install directly from
the GitHub repository using `pip` under the virtual environment. The first method leverages `pip`'s ability to install
directly from GitHub...

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/PGFinder.git
```

Alternatively you can clone the repository and then install it...

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Mesnage-Org/pgfinder.git
cd pgfinder
pip install .
```

  abstract = {Microbiota, and the plethora of signalling molecules that they generate, are a major driving force that underlies a striking range of inter-individual physioanatomic and behavioural consequences for the host organism. Among the bacterial effectors, one finds peptidoglycan, the major constituent of the bacterial cell surface. In the steady-state, fragments of peptidoglycan are constitutively liberated from bacterial members of the gut microbiota, cross the gut epithelial barrier and enter the host system. The fate of these peptidoglycan fragments, and the outcome for the host, depends on the molecular nature of the peptidoglycan, as well the cellular profile of the recipient tissue, mechanism of cell entry, the expression of specific processing and recognition mechanisms by the cell, and the local immune context. At the target level, physiological processes modulated by peptidoglycan are extremely diverse, ranging from immune activation to small molecule metabolism, autophagy and apoptosis. In this review, we bring together a fragmented body of literature on the kinetics and dynamics of peptidoglycan interactions with the mammalian host, explaining how peptidoglycan functions as a signalling molecule in the host under physiological conditions, how it disseminates within the host, and the cellular responses to peptidoglycan.},

  abstract = {Gut bacteria influence brain functions and metabolism. We investigated whether this influence can be mediated by direct sensing of bacterial cell wall components by brain neurons. In mice, we found that bacterial peptidoglycan plays a major role in mediating gut-brain communication via the Nod2 receptor. Peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides reach the brain and alter the activity of a subset of brain neurons that express Nod2. Activation of Nod2 in hypothalamic inhibitory neurons is essential for proper appetite and body temperature control, primarily in females. This study identifies a microbe-sensing mechanism that regulates feeding behavior and host metabolism.},

  abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that the gut microbiota profoundly influences many aspects of host development and physiology, including the modulation of brain development and behavior. However, the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in communication between the microbiota and the developing brain remain to be fully elucidated. Germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize conserved microbial molecular signatures such as bacterial surface molecules (e.g., peptidoglycans, PGNs) have emerged as potential key regulators of gut microbiota-brain interactions. We highlight current evidence supporting multiple and essential roles for PGNs and their sensing molecules beyond innate immunity, extending to neurodevelopment and behavior. In addition, the possible implications of the PGN signaling pathway for the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are considered.},

  abstract = {Many software solutions are available for proteomics and glycomics studies, but none are ideal for the structural analysis of peptidoglycan (PG), the essential and major component of bacterial cell envelopes. It icomprises glycan chains and peptide stems, both containing unusual amino acids and sugars. This has forced the field to rely on manual analysis approaches, which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to error. The lack of automated tools has hampered the ability to perform high-throughput analyses and prevented the adoption of a standard methodology. Here, we describe a novel tool called PGFinder for the analysis of PG structure and demonstrate that it represents a powerful tool to quantify PG fragments and discover novel structural features. Our analysis workflow, which relies on open-access tools, is a breakthrough towards a consistent and reproducible analysis of bacterial PGs. It represents a significant advance towards peptidoglycomics as a full-fledged discipline.},

  abstract = {The peptidoglycan (murein) sacculus is a unique and essential structural element in the cell wall of most bacteria. Made of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides, the sacculus forms a closed, bag-shaped structure surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane. There is a high diversity in the composition and sequence of the peptides in the peptidoglycan from different species. Furthermore, in several species examined, the fine structure of the peptidoglycan significantly varies with the growth conditions. Limited number of biophysical data on the thickness, elasticity and porosity of peptidoglycan are available. The different models for the architecture of peptidoglycan are discussed with respect to structural and physical parameters.},

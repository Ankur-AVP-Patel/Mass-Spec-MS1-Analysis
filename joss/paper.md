# Summary

Peptidoglycan is a key components in the cell surface of bacteria with numerous essential roles including ensuring
mechanical stability and mediating interactions with the environment and host. Understanding its biogenesis and
structure is key to understanding how cell surface properties modulate antimicrobial resistance and host-pathogen
interactions. The field of _Peptidoglycomics_ seeks to model and determine the structure of these molecules based on
laboratory based chromatography is in its infancy but progress will be greatly facilitated by development of software
tools such as `PGFinder` which introduces a streamlined workflow pipelines for analysing and working with laboratory
generated data.

# Statement of need

The fields of Proteomics and Glycomics have many software solutions available, but none are currently suited to the
analysis of peptidoglycan molecules which are made from a backbone of glycan chains with peptide side-chains each of
which are themselves composed of unusual sugars and amino acids. As a consequence researchers have traditionally relied
on laborious and error prone manual analysis of data generated from Reversed-Phase High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography
(RP-HPLC) and mass spectroscopy (MS) as no automated tools were available. `PGFinder` is implemented the popular Python
language and addresses this short-coming by introducing an automated workflow of PG structural analysis built on
open-access principles that enable replicable and reproducible analyses to be undertaken and in turn peer-reviewed. As
such `PGFinder` instantiates the field of peptidoglycomics on a firm footing.

# Package Overview

An overview of the iterative search strategy used in the workflow is shown in figure \ref{fig:workflow}.`PGFinder` uses
 a list of theoretical masses for a given set of known molecules based on their molecular structure (Database 1).
 Experimental data from mass spectroscopy is matched to these within a defined tolerance to give the matched theoretical
 monomer masses (Library 1). This library forms the basis of a second _in silico_ database of possible dimers and
 trimers that may be formed (Database 2) and these were again compared to the observed masses to generate a second
 library of matched theoretical dimers and trimers (Library 2). A third library (Library 3) is then derived of possible
 modifications that may arise through modifications which contains only modified muropeptides of matched monomers,
 dimers and trimers. Further details of the molecular aspects are given in [@Patel2021Sep].

**TODO** Please review the above, I've attempted to refine and simplify the second paragraph under _Results_ of [@Patel2021Sep].

# Resources and Examples

`PGFinder` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pgfinder/) and the development code is openly available on
[GitHub](https://pypi.org/project/pgfinder/). Documentation is also available
[online](https://mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder/) and example Jupyter Notebooks are available in Google Colab for users
to test and use. An example of command line usage is provided below

```bash
$ pip install pgfinder
